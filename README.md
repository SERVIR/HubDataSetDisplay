HubDataSetDisplay
=================
The files for displaying harvested data from GeoNode

This application does lazy loading of data harvested from GeoNode datasets.  Some of the features are cloning templated div elements for both the datagrid as well as the detail views of all data

To use this code You will need SQL or some other database source that will return data incrementally as requested.  See the harvesting branch for more details on that portion.
